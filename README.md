## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Guidelines to handle repository issues

All issues regarding bug fixes, additional feature requests, UI fixes etc. will be posted in the "Issues" section. 

To work on an issue, you must claim it first. Comment on the issue saying that you want to work on it. The respective lead will assign the issue to you and only then can you start working on it. 

Create a new branch with the following naming scheme: ```initials/component/change``` and then create a PR. Make sure to add yourself as the assignee and add your Tech Lead as the reviewer.

Make sure your PRs clearly explain what changes you've made. Include clear bulleted points regarding your changes and upload screenshots showing your work. 

Also, NEVER MERGE any pull request to the main branch. That's only for your Tech Lead to do. Only create the PR and then reply back to the issue. If everything goes well, your code will be merged into ```staging``` and the lead will mark the issue as closed.
