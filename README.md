## üöÄ Getting Started

To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   First, clone the repository to your local machine by running the following command:
   ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/SRM-IST-KTR/githubsrmv2.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:  
   Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:  
   Use the command below to start the server locally:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

4. **View the project**:  
   Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the result.

5. **Edit the project**:  
   You can start editing the project by modifying `pages/index.js`. Any changes you make will automatically refresh in the browser.

6. **API Routes**:  
   API routes can be accessed at http://localhost:3000/api/hello.  
   This route can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`. The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory behave as API routes, not as React pages.

7. **Font Optimization**:  
   This project uses `next/font` to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
